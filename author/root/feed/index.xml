<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ingredients</h3>



<ul>
<li>150ml greek yogurt</li>



<li>½ a clove garlic, crushed</li>



<li>finely chopped to make 1 tbsp dill</li>



<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>



<li>3 tbsp salted butter</li>



<li>½ tsp hot smoked paprika</li>



<li>2 eggs, (as fresh as possible)</li>



<li>a small handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>



<li>2 slices sourdough, griddled</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Method</h3>



<p><strong>STEP 1</strong><br>Put the greek yogurt in a large bowl and whisk in the garlic, dill, olive oil and some seasoning. Leave on the side while you prep the rest of the ingredients so the yogurt can lose the chill of the fridge.</p>



<p><strong>STEP 2</strong><br>Heat the butter in a small pan until melted, stir in the paprika and leave over a low heat.</p>



<p><strong>STEP 3</strong><br>Poach the eggs by gently cracking into a pan of just-simmering water. Leave for 2-3 minutes then scoop out with a slotted spoon and gently poke the yolk to see if it is done to your liking. Drain on kitchen paper.</p>



<p><strong>STEP 4</strong><br>Divide the yogurt between 2 bowls. Add an egg to each then drizzle over the paprika butter and sprinkle with a little parsley. Serve with the sourdough for dunking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a fast-paced world where time is of the essence, technology is stepping up to redefine the way we approach daily tasks, particularly in the heart of our homes—the kitchen. Time-saving appliances are taking center stage, with brands leveraging smart technology to make everything from meal planning to cooking more efficient and hassle-free. Let&#8217;s delve into the exciting realm of these cutting-edge appliances that promise to lend a helping hand in our busy lives.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Smart Meal Planning</h3>



<p>Imagine having a personal assistant dedicated to meal planning, and that&#8217;s precisely what some innovative appliances offer. Smart refrigerators equipped with touchscreens and connectivity features allow users to take inventory of their fridge, plan meals based on available ingredients, and even generate shopping lists. This not only reduces food waste but also streamlines the meal preparation process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Connected Cooking Appliances</h3>



<p>The evolution of smart cooking appliances is transforming the culinary landscape. Brands are introducing ovens, stovetops, and even slow cookers with built-in smart technology. These devices can be controlled remotely via smartphone apps, allowing users to preheat the oven, adjust cooking temperatures, or receive notifications when a dish is ready—all from the convenience of their fingertips.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. AI-Powered Recipe Suggestions</h3>



<p>Gone are the days of flipping through cookbooks or scrolling endlessly through recipe websites. Some appliances now come with artificial intelligence capabilities that analyze your cooking habits and suggest personalized recipes based on your preferences and dietary restrictions. This not only saves time on meal planning but also adds a touch of creativity to your culinary repertoire.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Multi-Functional Kitchen Gadgets</h3>



<p>Versatility is key when it comes to time-saving appliances. Brands are designing multi-functional gadgets that can perform a variety of tasks, reducing the need for multiple tools cluttering up your kitchen. From blender-steamers to combination coffee makers with built-in grinders, these all-in-one devices simplify the cooking and preparation process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">5. Automated Cleaning Solutions</h3>



<p>Keeping a kitchen clean is a task in itself, but smart appliances are easing the burden. Dishwashers with sensors that optimize water usage, self-cleaning ovens, and robotic vacuum cleaners designed for kitchen floors are just a few examples of how technology is streamlining the cleaning process, giving you more time to focus on the things that matter.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. Voice-Activated Controls</h3>



<p>The era of voice-activated assistants has extended to the kitchen. Appliances equipped with voice recognition technology respond to commands, allowing users to control settings, set timers, or even ask for recipe instructions without lifting a finger. This hands-free approach enhances convenience and accessibility in the kitchen.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">7. Energy-Efficient Innovations</h3>



<p>In addition to saving time, modern appliances are also designed with energy efficiency in mind. Smart technology enables devices to optimize energy usage, contributing to both a reduction in utility bills and a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>



<p>As we navigate the demands of contemporary living, these time-saving appliances are becoming indispensable tools in our kitchens. Brands are not just selling gadgets; they&#8217;re offering solutions to the time constraints that many individuals face. Whether you&#8217;re a busy professional, a parent juggling multiple responsibilities, or simply someone who values efficiency, these smart appliances are revolutionizing the way we approach daily life in the kitchen. Embrace the future of cooking and make more time for the things you love with these cutting-edge innovations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dessert enthusiasts and foodies, brace yourselves for a culinary journey into the world of sweet sorcery where pastry chefs are not just bakers but creators of edible art. In recent times, there has been an enchanting trend in the culinary realm – a surge of creative desserts and pastry innovations that go beyond the ordinary. From mind-bending flavor combinations to artistic plating and the incorporation of unexpected ingredients, let&#8217;s explore the captivating universe where desserts become an expression of culinary magic.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Flavor Alchemy: Unlikely Pairings that Dazzle the Palate</strong></h3>



<p>Pastry chefs are challenging conventional flavor norms, weaving together unexpected ingredients to create taste sensations that defy expectations. Imagine a delicate lavender-infused chocolate paired with tangy passion fruit or a savory bacon ice cream adorned with a drizzle of maple syrup. These bold flavor fusions elevate desserts to a new level, leaving taste buds tingling with delight and surprise.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Artistic Plating: Desserts as Canvas</strong></h3>



<p>Beyond taste, the presentation of desserts has become an art form in itself. Pastry chefs are transforming plates into canvases, skillfully arranging components to create visually stunning masterpieces. From intricate sugar sculptures to edible flowers and vibrant sauces delicately drizzled, each dessert is a work of art, inviting diners to savor the visual feast before indulging in the sweet symphony of flavors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Texture Play: Crunchy, Creamy, and Everything In Between</strong></h3>



<p>Texture is taking center stage in dessert innovation. Chefs are experimenting with contrasting textures, combining the creamy with the crunchy and the smooth with the chewy. Picture a velvety chocolate mousse paired with a crispy hazelnut crust or a delicate panna cotta juxtaposed with a crunchy praline. These textural surprises add layers of complexity to every bite, turning each dessert into a sensory adventure.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unexpected Ingredients: From the Kitchen to the Garden</strong></h3>



<p>Pastry chefs are raiding the pantry and the garden alike for inspiration. Unexpected ingredients like herbs, spices, and even vegetables are finding their way into desserts, creating harmonious blends that tantalize the taste buds. Basil-infused sorbets, rosemary-scented macarons, or beetroot-infused chocolate cakes are just a glimpse into the world of inventive pairings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Interactive Desserts: Culinary Experiences to Remember</strong></h3>



<p>Some chefs are turning desserts into interactive experiences. Picture a dessert served with a side of edible paint or a deconstructed masterpiece that invites diners to assemble their own sweet symphony. These interactive elements add an element of playfulness to the dining experience, engaging both the palate and the imagination.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Global Inspirations: Desserts Without Borders</strong></h3>



<p>The world is a treasure trove of flavors, and pastry chefs are exploring global inspirations to create desserts that transcend cultural boundaries. From matcha-infused tiramisu to cardamom-spiced baklava, these international twists on classic desserts provide a passport to a world of sweet indulgence.</p>



<p>In the realm of desserts and pastry, innovation knows no bounds. Pastry chefs are not just creators of confections; they are culinary storytellers, weaving narratives of flavor, texture, and visual splendor. As the boundaries between sweet and savory blur, and unexpected ingredients dance together on the plate, the world of desserts becomes a playground for the senses. So, let your sweet tooth be your guide as you embark on a delightful journey through the enchanting world of creative desserts and pastry wizardry.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been a significant shift in dietary choices, with a growing interest in plant-based and sustainable eating. This movement goes beyond just a trend; it reflects a conscious effort by individuals and communities to make food choices that are not only beneficial for personal health but also contribute to a more sustainable and ethical world. Let&#8217;s explore the key aspects of this culinary revolution.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Health Benefits of Plant-Based Diets</h3>



<p>Plant-based diets, centered around fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, have been associated with a plethora of health benefits. Studies suggest that these diets can lower the risk of heart disease, certain cancers, and type 2 diabetes. Packed with fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, plant-based meals promote overall well-being and vitality.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Environmental Impact and Sustainability</h3>



<p>One of the driving forces behind the surge in plant-based eating is its positive impact on the environment. Traditional animal agriculture is a major contributor to deforestation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable eating practices focus on minimizing this environmental footprint, emphasizing locally sourced, seasonal, and organic ingredients.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Culinary Innovation in Plant-Based Cuisine</h3>



<p>Chefs and restaurants are at the forefront of embracing plant-based ingredients, demonstrating that plant-based meals can be both delicious and satisfying. The culinary world is witnessing a creative renaissance, with chefs experimenting and crafting innovative dishes that showcase the versatility of plant-based ingredients. The goal is to create an inclusive dining experience that caters to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ethical Considerations Driving Choices</h3>



<p>Beyond personal health and environmental concerns, ethical considerations are driving many towards plant-based eating. Consumers are seeking transparency in the sourcing of their food, supporting businesses that prioritize ethical and sustainable practices. The connection between what&#8217;s on the plate and broader issues like animal welfare and sustainable farming practices is a driving force in shaping dietary choices.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Rise of Alternative Protein Sources</h3>



<p>In response to the demand for more sustainable protein options, there&#8217;s been a surge in the development and popularity of alternative protein sources. Plant-based meat substitutes and cultured meat are changing the landscape of protein consumption, offering alternatives that align with the principles of plant-based and sustainable eating.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Education and Awareness</h3>



<p>The rise of plant-based and sustainable eating is not just about changing diets; it&#8217;s a movement fueled by education and awareness. Documentaries, social media, and educational initiatives play a crucial role in disseminating information about the impact of dietary choices on personal health and the planet.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Corporate Initiatives and Mainstream Adoption</h3>



<p>The shift towards plant-based and sustainable eating is not limited to individual choices. Larger food corporations and restaurant chains are recognizing the demand for ethical and sustainable food options. Menus are evolving to incorporate plant-based choices, reflecting a broader shift in consumer preferences.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Lifestyle and Community Movement</h3>



<p>Plant-based and sustainable eating is not merely a diet; it&#8217;s a lifestyle. It involves mindfulness about food choices, physical well-being, and a sense of community around shared values. Individuals adopting this lifestyle often find themselves part of a broader movement striving for a healthier, more sustainable world.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the plant-based and sustainable eating revolution is more than a passing trend; it&#8217;s a transformative shift in how we view food and its impact on our health and the planet. As chefs continue to innovate, consumers become more informed, and businesses adapt, we can anticipate a future where plant-based and sustainable eating becomes the norm rather than the exception, creating a positive ripple effect for generations to come.</p>
